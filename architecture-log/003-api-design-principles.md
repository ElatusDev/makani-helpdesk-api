# Decision Proposal: REST API w/ OpenAPI & Spring Boot Modules

**Date:** 2025-04-19

**Proposed By:** [Your Name/Team Name]

**Location Context:** Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico

**Context:**

Backend API for Arts Academy needs design for clients (web, mobile).
Handles operations: daily mgmt, assistance, notifications,
accounting, payments, training, payroll.
Proposes REST, OpenAPI (Swagger), and Spring Boot modules.

**Proposed Decision:**

Design API using REST, OpenAPI (Swagger), and Spring Boot modules.

**Rationale:**

Our decision to adopt a RESTful API architecture, documented with the
OpenAPI specification, and implemented using Spring Boot modules is
driven by factors ensuring a scalable, maintainable, well-documented,
and developer-friendly backend for the Arts Academy application in
Guadalajara.

1.  **RESTful Architecture (Representational State Transfer):**
    * **Ubiquity and Familiarity:** REST is widely adopted and
      well-understood, meaning more developers (including in
      Guadalajara) are familiar, reducing learning curve.
    * **Simplicity and Clarity:** Stateless, resource-based, standard
      HTTP methods, uniform interface lead to intuitive API design.
    * **Scalability:** Stateless nature allows handling many concurrent
      requests without server sessions, crucial for potential growth.
    * **Cacheability:** Leverages HTTP caching, improving performance
      and reducing server load for frequent data.
    * **Interoperability:** Works across platforms/languages (JSON),
      supports web/mobile clients, future integrations.

2.  **OpenAPI Specification (Swagger):**
    * **Contract-First Development:** Defining API spec early creates
      clear contract, facilitates parallel frontend/backend work.
    * **Comprehensive and Living Documentation:** Auto-generated,
      up-to-date docs. Swagger UI for interactive exploration/testing.
    * **Code Generation Capabilities:** Generates server stubs/client
      SDKs, reducing boilerplate, ensuring consistency with the spec.
    * **API Governance and Standardization:** Consistent API definition
      across the Arts Academy application.

3.  **Spring Boot Modules:**
    * **Logical Organization and Maintainability:** Modules by function
      (`student-api`) improve code navigation and upkeep.
    * **Improved Separation of Concerns (Clean Architecture):** API
      concerns in controllers are separate from business logic.
    * **Enhanced Testability:** Focused testing of individual API
      modules and their service interactions.
    * **Increased Reusability:** Potential reuse/extension of well-defined
      API modules in future Arts Academy projects.
    * **Better Team Collaboration:** Teams in Guadalajara can focus on
      specific API modules, improving parallel development.

In summary, REST, OpenAPI, and Spring Boot modules offer a robust,
scalable, well-documented, and developer-friendly foundation for the
Arts Academy backend API, considering the team in Guadalajara.

**Alternatives Considered:**

* **GraphQL:**
    * **Pros:** Clients request only needed data, reducing over-fetching.
      Single endpoint simplifies interaction. Strong typing.
    * **Cons:** Steeper learning curve. Complex queries can cause
      performance issues. Over-fetching still possible. Needs server.
    * **Reason for Not Choosing Initially:** REST is more widely
      understood. Revisit if data fetching becomes a bottleneck.

* **gRPC:**
    * **Pros:** High-performance, language-agnostic. Efficient for
      microservices. Supports streaming.
    * **Cons:** More complex setup/debugging than REST. Needs Protocol
      Buffers. Limited browser support (needs gateway).
    * **Reason for Not Choosing Initially:** REST with JSON has broader
      client support. gRPC performance not critical initially.

* **No API (Direct Database Access):**
    * **Pros:** Simplest initial implementation for small teams.
    * **Cons:** Violates separation of concerns, couples clients to DB,
      security risks, hard to maintain/evolve, no central control.
    * **Reason for Not Choosing:** Not a viable long-term solution.

**Other Considerations:**

* **Data Format:** Primarily JSON for requests/responses.
* **Auth/Authz:** JWT for auth, RBAC for access control.
* **Versioning:** API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`).
* **Error Handling:** Standard HTTP codes & JSON errors.
* **Filtering/Sorting/Pagination:** For resource collections.
* **Rate Limiting:** To prevent API abuse.
* **Async (Notifications):** Consider for email/WhatsApp.
* **Locale/Timezone (Guadalajara):** Handle consistently.
* **Doc Accessibility:** Easy access to Swagger UI.

**Expected Consequences:**

* **Benefits:** Well-documented, easy-to-use API. Better frontend/
  backend collaboration. Faster development. Maintainable, scalable
  backend. Secure API access. Flexible for various clients.
* **Potential Drawbacks:** Initial OpenAPI spec design effort. Requires
  REST principles adherence. Careful module boundary planning.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Define initial API endpoints & resources.
2.  Create OpenAPI specification.
3.  Implement endpoints using Spring Boot modules.
4.  Integrate Swagger UI.
5.  Implement auth/authz.

This API design provides a well-established and flexible approach for
the Arts Academy backend in Guadalajara.
